          <h2>2FA helps to keep hackers at bay</h2>
          <p>Passwords can be digitally stolen. But to steal a phone requires physical exertion. This is what gives you that extra layer of protection. While a hacker can comfortably sit at home to steal your password, getting your phone requires a lot more effort. <br/><br/> 

            Do your part! Piss off a hacker and add some extra security to all your accounts -  enable 2FA!</p>

          <h2>How does it work?</h2>
          <p>2FA Notifier simply compares the website you are visiting to a list of known 2FA capable websites provided by twofactorauth.org. If the website is in our list, we notify you to enable 2FA. </p>
