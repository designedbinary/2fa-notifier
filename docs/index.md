<h1 class="nav-header">2FA Notifier</h1>

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is a fantastic way to make it harder for hackers to hijack your accounts, even if they somehow steal your password.

**But, it only works if you actually enable it!!**

2FA Notifier let's you know which sites you visit
support 2FA and specifically how to enable it.
